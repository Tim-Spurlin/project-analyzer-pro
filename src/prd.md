- **Design Personality**: Dense information presentation with clear organization and high contrast
- **Visual Metaphors**: Document processing, detailed analysis, comprehensive extraction
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Information-rich interface with clear visual hierarchy

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: High contrast dark mode with strategic accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Electric blue (#3b82f6) for technical precision and clarity
- **Secondary Colors**: Deep grays and charcoals for dark mode foundation
- **Accent Color**: Bright cyan (#06b6d4) for interactive elements and highlights
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys technical expertise, cyan provides high visibility for actions
- **Color Accessibility**: Extreme contrast ratios for optimal readability
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (very dark): Bright white text (21:1 ratio)
  - Card (dark gray): White text (16:1 ratio)
  - Primary (blue): White text (8.2:1 ratio)
  - Secondary (darker): Light cyan text (9.1:1 ratio)
  - Accent (cyan): Dark text (12.6:1 ratio)
  - Code blocks: High contrast syntax highlighting

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code blocks
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Strong contrast between heading weights and sizes
- **Font Personality**: Maximum legibility with technical precision
- **Readability Focus**: Optimized for dense information consumption
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent spacing for code and content blocks
- **Which fonts**: Inter for interface, JetBrains Mono for code (highly legible monospace)
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts provide exceptional clarity in dark mode

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Code blocks prominently featured with clear copy buttons
- **White Space Philosophy**: Balanced density with clear section separation
- **Grid System**: Flexible layout adapting to content density needs
- **Responsive Approach**: Maintains readability across all screen sizes
- **Content Density**: Maximum information per screen while preserving usability

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Smooth transitions for copy actions and content loading

- **Component Hierarchy**: Copy buttons primary, navigation secondary, settings tertiary
- **Spacing System**: Consistent padding around code blocks and content sections
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Responsive code blocks with horizontal scrolling when needed

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based with focus on code presentation
- **Style Guide Elements**: Code block styling, copy button placement, section headers
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing between explanations and code blocks
- **Brand Alignment**: Technical documentation aesthetic with professional polish

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: Exceeds WCAG AAA standards for maximum readability in dark mode

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Large Codebase Handling**: Intelligent chunking while maintaining context
- **Token Limit Management**: Optimize content density within AI platform constraints
