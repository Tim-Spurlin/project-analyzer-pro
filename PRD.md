# Project Analyzer - Product Requirements Document

A comprehensive tool that processes uploaded project folders and generates multiple types of documentation and analysis outputs while respecting token limitations of AI platforms.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Efficient** - Processes large codebases quickly with intelligent chunking and analysis
2. **Comprehensive** - Generates diverse output formats from documentation to visual diagrams
3. **Professional** - Dark, high-contrast interface suitable for development workflows

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, multiple processing modes)
- Handles file system operations, AI processing, multiple export formats, and complex data transformations

## Essential Features

### File Upload System
- **Functionality**: Drag-and-drop or browse upload for project folders
- **Purpose**: Easy ingestion of entire project structures
- **Trigger**: User drags folder or clicks upload area
- **Progression**: Drop/select folder → file validation → structure analysis → processing queue
- **Success criteria**: All supported files parsed and ready for analysis

### Intelligent Processing Engine
- **Functionality**: Analyzes codebase while respecting AI token limitations
- **Purpose**: Generate meaningful insights without hitting platform constraints
- **Trigger**: User initiates processing after upload
- **Progression**: File analysis → chunking strategy → AI processing → result compilation
- **Success criteria**: Complete analysis delivered within token limits

### Multi-Format Export System
- **Functionality**: Generate PDF, PNG/JPG, structured prompts, implementation plans, diagrams, JSON schema, README.md
- **Purpose**: Provide outputs suitable for different use cases and audiences
- **Trigger**: User selects desired output formats
- **Progression**: Format selection → processing → preview → download/export
- **Success criteria**: High-quality outputs in requested formats

### Visual Diagram Generation
- **Functionality**: Create architecture diagrams, flowcharts, component relationships, data flow diagrams
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of project structure and relationships
- **Trigger**: User selects diagram types from preview gallery
- **Progression**: Diagram type selection → data processing → chart generation → export option
- **Success criteria**: Accurate, professional diagrams reflecting project structure

### Q&A Documentation Generator
- **Functionality**: Convert documentation into structured question-answer format
- **Purpose**: Create interactive, searchable knowledge base from project docs
- **Trigger**: User selects Q&A format option
- **Progression**: Doc analysis → question generation → answer extraction → structured output
- **Success criteria**: Comprehensive Q&A covering all major project aspects

## Edge Case Handling

- **Large File Handling**: Chunk processing with progress indicators and memory management
- **Unsupported Files**: Clear feedback on skipped files with reasoning
- **Processing Failures**: Graceful degradation with partial results and retry options
- **Export Errors**: Format-specific error handling with alternative suggestions
- **Network Issues**: Offline processing where possible with clear status indicators

## Design Direction

The interface should feel like a professional development tool - dark, focused, and efficient with high contrast for accessibility and reduced eye strain during extended use.

## Color Selection

Custom palette with high contrast dark theme optimized for accessibility and professional development workflows.

- **Primary Color**: Electric Blue (#0EA5E9) - Commands attention for primary actions and processing states
- **Secondary Colors**: Steel Gray (#64748B) for secondary actions and neutral elements
- **Accent Color**: Emerald Green (#10B981) for success states and completion indicators
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (Dark Slate #0F172A): Light Gray text (#F1F5F9) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Card (Slate Gray #1E293B): Light Gray text (#F1F5F9) - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Electric Blue #0EA5E9): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓
  - Secondary (Steel Gray #64748B): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 5.1:1 ✓
  - Accent (Emerald Green #10B981): White text (#FFFFFF) - Ratio 4.2:1 ✓

## Font Selection

Inter for its excellent readability and professional appearance in development contexts, with clear hierarchy supporting complex information display.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Subsections): Inter Medium/20px/normal spacing
  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Code/Technical: Inter Regular/14px/monospace characteristics

## Animations

Subtle, purposeful animations that communicate processing states and guide user attention through complex workflows without being distracting.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Progress indicators, state transitions, and subtle hover effects that reinforce the professional development tool aesthetic
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Upload animations, processing progress, and export confirmations take priority over decorative effects

## Component Selection

- **Components**: Dialog for settings, Card for file displays, Tabs for output selection, Progress for processing, Button variants for different actions, Sheet for detailed views
- **Customizations**: Custom file drop zone, processing visualization, diagram preview gallery, export format selector
- **States**: Clear loading, success, error, and processing states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons emphasizing file operations, processing states, and export actions
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit spacing scale (16px, 24px, 32px) for clear information hierarchy
- **Mobile**: Responsive grid system with stacked layouts and touch-optimized controls for smaller screens
